# team-local-tactics
A game for the mandatory assignment

My team only consist of me, myself and I.

To start the game:
1. Navigate to the correct path of the folder that the code is located in.
1. Run the server.py file in the terminal with "python server.py".
2. Open a new terminal-window, and type "python client.py" to initiate the first player.
3. Do the same as above one more time to initiate a second player.
4. When both clients have connected, the players will be prompted one at a time to choose their "champions".
5. After both players has chosen two players each, the game will simulate a game round and the result will be displayed for both the players.
